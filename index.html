<h1>A little about me</h1>
<p> I am a sports- loving boy, and I participate in any sports competitions that I come across! Mostly though, I like to sprint. As for my hobbies, I used to play table tennis in my Primary School, I was even in the school team! But now, I am in Volleyball CCA, and I am still getting the hang of this new sport. For my subjects, I love mostly English and Mathematics. Also, I am an avid video-gamer, prefering more of a "shoot-shoot-bang-bang" kind of games. And that's me! Nicholas Ng! (Take note of the surname! There are two of us in my class, 1 Eilyse, or 1E for short)</html>
