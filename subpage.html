<p> This is a First-Person-Shooter game called Critical Ops, or C-Ops as some of us like to call it. It is a very fun game and I have become very good at it. My kill-death-ratio, or kdr, is 1.25, which simply means I have a estimated calculation of 1.25 kills per every death. Despite what you might think, this kdr is actually quite high up the ranks. I love this game and I am good at it.</p>
